### `npm test`

This code runs the `npm test` command, which executes the test scripts defined in the files. After running the tests, the output will show whether the tests have passed or failed, along with any error messages or stack traces. It is important to run tests regularly to ensure that the code is functioning as expected and to catch any bugs or issues early on in the development process.
